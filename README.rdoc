== The Architecture
Pathfounder weaves two sets of data together in a contextual and accessible way in Ruby

There is Normalized data that is saved in the database. These are the result of specific Character choices - the specific ability bonus that a human gets, or how many points they have in strength.

There is also static data that stays in the classes. This represents truths about the various roles and races that are unchanging regardless of the choices made by a character. A fighter will always give a +2 to reflex, a human will always be normal speed, etc.

The Two mix in the model layer, where they are calculated to specific values based on Algorithms in the Game System.
